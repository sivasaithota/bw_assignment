> Automated using [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [JEST](https://jestjs.io/).

<!-- [START usecases] -->
###### What I did?

* Automated 3 cases(Happy flow) 
  1)Login
  2)Creating a Open post
  3)Creating a Multiple Choice Post
 
* Create Post is  generic method which handles both open/multipleChoice post with respective parameters. 
* Validating the Test by asserting the post question.
* HTML report and JSON report will be generated at the end of the test. (under reports/html-report/).
* Screenshots of failed tests will be stored under reports/screenshot.
* Used Config package.By default it takes default.json, we can use this for other environment like QA,DEV,Staging.
* This framework can run test in parallel.
